# Upstaged
Upstaged is a 4 player drawing game utilizing eye tracking where the goal is to get people to look at your drawing the most. It utilizes the WebGazer.js library for eye tracking on desktop (and mobile?). Users can create a new room for their game and invite players with a special link, then once everyone is in the room and ready, each player will have a minute to create a drawing and choose how it will move around the page, then a small animation will be shown to the player and we will track how long each player looks at each drawing during the animation, and then the user with the highest cumulative watch time wins. There can be up to 4 players and up to 16 spectators in each room.
